Welcome to the Bobble AI Modifications repository! This project showcases various enhancements and additional features incorporated into the Bobble AI application.

# Overview
Bobble AI is an innovative application known for its advanced features in photo editing and customization. In this repository, we have extended the capabilities of Bobble AI by integrating the following enhancements:

# 1. Caricatures
We've introduced a new feature that allows users to create caricatures of their photos. This feature utilizes advanced algorithms to distort facial features in a humorous and artistic manner, providing users with a fun and entertaining way to customize their images.

# 2. Filter Camera
Enhancing the photography experience, we've implemented a Filter Camera feature within Bobble AI. Users can now apply a wide range of filters and effects in real-time while capturing photos, enabling them to instantly add creativity and style to their images before sharing them with others.

# 3. Avatar
With the Avatar feature, users can easily create personalized avatars based on their own photos. This feature utilizes machine learning techniques to generate lifelike avatars that resemble the user's facial characteristics, offering a unique and engaging way to express oneself in digital environments.
